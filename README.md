## Certificate Template

YouthMappersAGU has created a format for a certificate to be sent to those who participated in the Mappathon in support of Turkey and Syria.
All YouthMappers chapters and organisers of mapping events in support of Turkey and Syria are free to use it.

## How to edit 
There is an Illustrator file that can be downloaded to easily create a certificate.
Basically it can be created by editing the components stored in the layer marked 'edit it'.

The "edit it" layer contains the name of the participant, the signature of the organising organisation and the date component.
By editing here, you can easily create certificates.
